- Live Site URL: [Example on Netlify](https://kind-goldwasser-a93aeb.netlify.app/)

## My process

I started by working out how many seperate sections I would require, then built a grid for the large screen version of the site.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Made the site fully responsive regardless of the users base font-size. Used a mobile first workflow and then added CSS Grid for large screen users. Used CSS Grid which I had only used once before.

### Continued development

I will continue with the mobile first and responsive philosophy as for me it simplifies the development process due to native code without any styling is responsive from the outset.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Generator by Sarah Drasner](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
